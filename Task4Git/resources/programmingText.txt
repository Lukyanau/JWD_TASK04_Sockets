We can have different type of houses, such as Wooden House and Glass House.
Hi hi.
House.
Here is the code.
***
public class WoodenHouse extends HouseTemplate {
    @Override
    public void buildWalls() {
        System.out.println("Building Wooden Walls");
    }
    @Override
    public void buildPillars() {
        System.out.println("Building Pillars with Wood coating");
    }
}
****
We could have overridden other methods also, but for simplicity I am not doing that.
